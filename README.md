# Example Inquiry
To inquire a class card, the system will need two inputs from the user, barcode or their ID number and a Special Key(given by the class adviser).

A quick example to see the inquiry works, see below

Barcode: 123
Special Key: AntoninoA

# Admin Operations
There are many different admin operations in the site, they are self-explanatory, just explore them.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks to sir Antonino Fabillar for creating such wonderful program for future IT's to use as preference.

# Class Card Inquiry .NET Visual Basic
